# OffMyChest-Tri-CoHackathon
The anonymous mental health crisis live chat prepared for Tri-Co Hackathon at Haverford, was awarded 3rd place

What is “Off My Chest”?
“Off My Chest” is a project prepared for Tri-Co Hackathon at Haverford college. 
This project's inspiration was the increasing number of people struggling with mental health who can’t access any help or are afraid of doing it. 

What does it do?
“Off My Chest” is an anonymous mental health crisis live chat where people are paired with a help provider.

How we built it? 

We divided the project into several parts:
1. Creating servers for live chat and chat layout
2. Create a waiting room to match people
3. Сreate a homepage

We successfully did the first part of creating a server using the Socket.io module (please see the “server.js” file), adding functions for the client to send messages and the server to receive and send messages to other clients(please see the file “script.js”). Also, we created the layout for the chat room using HTML and CSS (please see the files “chatroom.css” and “chatroom.html”) 
For the second part, we also used sockets, but we could not create a pairing system and layout due to a lack of time. 
For our homepage, we used HTML and CSS. (please see the file “website.html” and “style.css”)

The challenges we faced: 
We lacked experience in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and it was difficult to align the various buttons on the homepage.

What we are proud about: 
We created an actual working chat with a decent layout without having any experience with JavaScript and servers. 

What are the following steps:
Adding report and verification functions
Creating a mobile alternative for the website
